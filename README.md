# Prism.ShowingMultipleShells
This Prism application comes from Prism Problems & Solutions: Showing Multiple Shells on Pluralsight.com. It is informative, but a little outdated. This repository is updated for Prism 8 and .NET 5 using DryIoC. It only includes the final Lesson 4 solution, but you can use it to complete the others.
